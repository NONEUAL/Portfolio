## üì¶ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js)
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NONEUAL/Portfolio.git
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure you are cloning the correct repository, matching the casing if your actual repo is 'Portfolio' not 'portfolio' or 'Portfolio-main'.)*

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Portfolio/Portfolio-main 
    # Or 'cd Portfolio' if you moved the contents up a level during troubleshooting
    ```
    *(Verify your exact project structure. If your `package.json` is directly under `Portfolio`, then `cd Portfolio` is sufficient.)*

3.  **Install NPM dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running Locally

```bash
npm start
